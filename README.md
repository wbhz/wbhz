I'm a data scientist working on online safety at Bumble. I hold an MSc in Social Data Science from the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. I am particularly interested in Natural Language Processing techniques. My research focused on developing cross-lingual transfer learning models for topic classification of political text.
